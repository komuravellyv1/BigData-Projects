An important research question that can be asked about big data sets is whether you
 need to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data
 or is a sample good enough. The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this 
is an important characteristic of big data. But Sampling statistics enables the selection of right data 
points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. For example
 there are about million tweets produced every day. Is it necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics
 that are discussed during the day Is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the 
topics In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current
 voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict downtime it may not be 
necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient Big Data can be broken down by various
 data point categories such as demographic psychographic behavioral and transactional data With large sets
 of data points, marketers are able to create and utilize more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting.
There has been some work done in Sampling algorithms for big data. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed
